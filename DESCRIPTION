Description: Mito R detects genetic alterations in the mtADN and links them to different well known databases like Hmtvar, Franklin and VarSome.
It involves functions of softwares: GATK, BWA, Samtools, Picard and ExomeDepth. And provides a local database that saves the results obtained in order to make both, single and population based scenarios.
